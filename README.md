In this repository, I developed a code ('Ajuste_de_datos_NG1003.ipynb' in Modificaciones a SimpleMC) and modified the code 'Simple MC in Python to make a fitting of data from galaxies' curves profiles and their velocities, to prove one theoretical model for Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).

You can access the writing in the Reporte_final_v4_FINAL.pdf file.
